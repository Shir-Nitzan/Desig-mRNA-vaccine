# Design-mRNA-vaccine-SARS-CoV-2-variants
 The goal of this project is to update the mRNA vaccine based on the BA.2 Spike! (assume that the vaccine does not work for the BA.2 variant)
Designing an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants - 
In this work, we updated the mRNA vaccine based on the BA.2 spike.

This Project done by 2022.
First Part - basic analysis between Pfizer and moderna Vaccines.
Major findings include:
Second Part - comparison to the Wuhan strain:
We found that there were only two differences, and they are adjacent. One K in the Wuhan spike region is replaced by a P in the Pfizer spike region, and likewise for a V.

We found up the lookup table maps non-GC codons to GC codons thus increasing the GC content in the vaccine. This will increase the stability of the vaccine while maintaining the same amino-acid structure.

Behold our BA2 vaccine


We found that the KV being replaced by PP in the vaccine results in a stabilized spike protein in the eprefusion state and contributes to the efficiency of the vaccine. It is thought that the KV is probably not functionally important. Source: [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466921/)


Analysis of mutational antigenic profiling of barcoded codon variants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Study and analysis by Allie Greaney, Tyler Starr, Jesse Bloom, and co-authors. These experiments are described in Greaney, et. al, Science Translational Medicine (2021).

This work examines mutations that reduce binding by polyclonal serum antibodies from individuals vaccinated with the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, and compares the results to those from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The vaccine samples are from the mRNA-1273 phase 1 study, funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
