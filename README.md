# :test_tube: Designing an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants
In this work, we updated the mRNA vaccine based on the BA.2 spike! (assume that the vaccine does not work for the BA.2 variant).


Major findings include:
First Part - analysis between Pfizer and moderna Vaccines:
We found that the coding regions of the vaccines are identical in the protein level.
On the nucleotide level, the coding regions of the vaccines are not identical.

Second Part - comparison to the Wuhan strain:
We found that there were only two differences, and they are adjacent:

One K in the Wuhan spike region is replaced by a P in the Pfizer spike region, and likewise for a V.

We found up the lookup table that mapping between the Wuhan strain codons to the Pfizer codons - 
maps non-GC codons to GC codons thus increasing the GC content in the vaccine. This will increase the stability of the vaccine while maintaining the same amino-acid structure.

Third Part - The variants

BA1-BA2 differences:
There are 21 differences, first difference at index 18
Length of proteins are the same: 1271
BA2 initiation codon is 50 indexes after BA1
Length of mRNA coding regions are both: 3813


We found that the KV being replaced by PP in the vaccine results in a stabilized spike protein in the eprefusion state and contributes to the efficiency of the vaccine. It is thought that the KV is probably not functionally important. Source: [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466921/).
Designing our BA2 vaccine included looking for all the places with substitutions and change the codons by the Pfizer lookup table (from last part).




## Use case üì≤
1. Run the python server from app.py start point.
2. Enter localhost:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```
3. Follow the demo:
